# Backyard Chickens
A non-technical talk for the Recurse Center

## Prequel
### We had some peach trees
* Japanese beetles started eating them
* Beetle traps?
* But not just a few eating my peaches
  - I mean a LOT
  - Ewwwww

### Possible solutions
* Pesticides
* Milky Spore
  - expensive
  - Your neighbor's problem now!

### Alternatives?
That's right -- Chickens!

## Backyard chickens 101

### Where?
* Is it legal?
* Chicken tractors, coops

### Lifecycle
  * Chicks in a box
  * Brooding
    - (95 - 5/week)F
    - 6 weeks they have feathers are are ready
    - 6 months and they lay
    - they lay for 4-6y
    - live for 5-10y!

### Making sure you get a hen....

"a professional sexer can sort a thousand birds an hour with over 98% accuracy — one Hugh Grove from Oregon could hit 1500 an hour at his peak. How do you get from “it’s yellow and it doesn’t have a penis, what?” to an average of 0.5 seconds per chick?"

How?
- Supervised learning of chick sexing
- just like a neural network
- immediate feedback

### Feeding
* insects (like Japanese beetles)
* chicken feed (control what goes in)
* seeds
* compost/yard waste
* OMNIVORES -- they've eaten mice, chicks, and even killed and nibbled a small rabbit  
### Dying
* diseases
* heat stroke
*  Predators
  - fox/racoon/coyote
  - hawks/raptors
  - people, after they stop laying
  - they do not taste great

### Eggs
- Start laying at ~6 months
- Color varies
- lay 0-1 eggs/day
- Stop laying around 4-6y
- break during the winter
- or molting
- or broody
